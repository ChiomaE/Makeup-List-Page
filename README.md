# Makeup Products Showcase

This project is a makeup products showcase built with React. It retrieves data from the Makeup API to display products from the Maybelline brand. Each product is displayed as a card, and users can view more details about a product by clicking on the "Product Details" button, which opens a modal displaying additional information about the selected product.

## Features
